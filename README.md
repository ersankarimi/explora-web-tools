<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Product Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

There are many great tools like this available out there. Me and my friend just want to try to make a tool like that that can be used by me and many people.

Here's why:

-   Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
-   Using tools, of course, will speed up our work.
-   With this tool will also make us write less code. Because we simply select the desired settings and retrieve the ready-made code instantly.

Sorry if not all the tools you are looking for are available on this website. So my friend and I will be adding more in no time. You can also suggest changes by forking this repo and making a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to everyone who has used, and contributed to the expansion of this tool we created!
